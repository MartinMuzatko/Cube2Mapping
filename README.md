#1. Introduction

##What the heck is this all about?

This book/guide/tutorial is about turning you into a level designer. People also prefer to say "Mapper" because in comparison, Cube2 aka 'Sauerbraten' does not come with as much features as Unreal Developer Kit or Farcry does. But Cube2 has his own idea of fun. What makes Sauerbraten so famous is its way to create worlds. Its Cooperative editmode, where you can create stuff simultaneously is very useful for being creative together. However, level design is not only a hobby, it is an occupation. All information you find in this guide may be applied on other games, I will however always include all essential information about how it's done in Cube2, and what about other games. The focus mainly relies on Cube2:Sauerbraten

This book will cover all the little secrets that you may wonder about: Why do some maps get played, others not? How are some levels fun while others are not fun to play? And eventually, why do some levels get into the next release and some not? Quadropolis is, a good place to start. It is a platform to rate and discuss about maps. If you think you got good material, thats the place to go.

##What are the requirements?

I will not tell you the very basics how to work with Cube2, this guide is for intermediate to expert creators. You should know your entities, how to modify them. How to texturize cubes and the different cubesizes. In the first chapter I will explain a few not so well known details about the cube. You will also need a lot of patience, as you need to get a feeling for whats good and whats not good to play.

##Get used to the cube

If you are not familiar with how to handle cube formations and you got no workflow in texturi
##Get used to the cube
##Different sizes
##Know your limits - WTR

#3. Layout

Creating a layout is the first step for beginning a project. You may have an idea in beforehand about the theme, look or feel, but it is by no means mandatory.
Some of my casual created maps that had no theme or concept intended became a Deathmatch map. It is very flexible, depending on how the map works without any details or color. 

We will go through the creation step by step. We have to know a few little things before we get started.

##Game mechanics

Every game has its unique set of rules. Consisting out of some constants like gravity, gamespeed, jumpheight and other stuff that creates the concept of the game itself. So unfortunatly you can't just make up your own rules in your world, you got to adapt to the existing gameplay and create layouts that utilize these constants. But there are a lot of other things that influence the gameplay. We have to take care of these entities, Which are weapons, different kinds of gamemodes, jumppads, teleports and a lot more. We will discover later what exactly can make or create a layout.  

Sauerbraten got a very fast gameplay. It is hard to create a Battlefield-similar game experience. Instead, Sauerbraten is known for its need for quick reflexes. Having enough room is important. Talking about every single room or corridor within the level.

##Building on the grid

##Where to start?

The worst thing how you could get started is to create yourself a border. You never know how big a map could possibly become.his is what a lot of beginners are not capable to do. Most newbies will try to work within a boxshaped map and do not dare to break through these walls, even if it would go with the gameflow.


##Go with the flow
