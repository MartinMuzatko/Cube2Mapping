#Introduction

##What the heck is this all about?

This book/guide/tutorial is about turning you into a level designer. People also prefer to say "Mapper" because in comparison, Cube2 aka 'Sauerbraten' does not come with as much features as Unreal Developer Kit or Farcry does. But Cube2 has his own idea of fun. What makes Sauerbraten so famous is its way to create worlds. Its Cooperative editmode, where you can create stuff simultaneously is very useful for being creative together. However, level design is not only a hobby, it is an occupation. All information you find in this guide may be applied on other games, I will however always include all essential information about how it's done in Cube2, and what about other games. The focus mainly relies on Cube2:Sauerbraten

This book will cover all the little secrets that you may wonder about: Why do some maps get played, others not? How are some levels fun while others are not fun to play? And eventually, why do some levels get into the next release and some not? Quadropolis is, a good place to start. It is a platform to rate and discuss about maps. If you think you got good material, thats the place to go.

##What are the requirements?

I will not tell you the very basics how to work with Cube2. You should know your entities, how to modify them. How to texturize cubes and the different cubesizes. In the first chapter I will explain a few not so well known details about the cube. You will also need a lot of patience, as you need to get a feeling for whats good and whats not good to play.
